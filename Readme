# Programmatic Access to Astronomical Objects in a Sky Region

This script enables automated querying of astronomical objects within a defined localization radius, combining deep survey data with all-sky resources.

## Part 1 — Legacy Survey DR10

Performs direct SQL queries to **Legacy Survey DR10** via `dl.queryClient`, similar to the official web tool. Visualization includes:

- Detected sources (red circles)
- Search radius (yellow circle)
- Optional survey background (e.g., Pan-STARRS, WISE)

## Part 2 — NED and All-Sky Surveys

Fallback for regions **not covered by Legacy Survey**, using `astroquery` to access objects from **NED** and visualize with all-sky surveys.

## Requirements

All dependencies are listed in the `environment.yml` file.
